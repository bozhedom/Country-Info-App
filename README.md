# React + Vite

The Country Info App is a React-based application that fetches data from the REST Countries API to display a list of countries. Users can click on any country to view detailed information about it, including the capital, flag, region, population, area, languages, and currency. The application is styled using Bootstrap to ensure a clean and responsive design.
